# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles configuration for macOS.

## Disclaimer

> **Use at your own risk!**

These dotfiles are tailored to my specific workflow and preferences. While you are free to clone, fork, use, and modify them as you see fit, I strongly recommend that you **do not** blindly apply these settings.

Instead:
1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Review the code and configurations.
3.  Cherry-pick the parts that are useful to you.
4.  Remove what you don't need or understand.

Most configurations include comments explaining their purpose and default values.

## Philosophy

The goal of this repository is to create a **lean, efficient, and modern** development environment.

-   **Not a Rice**: This is not intended to be a "rice" or a theme pack. It focuses on functionality and speed over flashy aesthetics.
-   **Modern Tools**: Utilizes modern replacements for legacy tools where appropriate (e.g., `eza`, `bat`, `fd`, `ripgrep`, `starship`, `neovim`, `zoxide`, `delta`, ...).

## Quickstart

```
./scripts/bootstrap/main.sh
```
